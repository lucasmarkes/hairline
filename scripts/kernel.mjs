 * HL: everything a figure may call. Read this index; the code under it is the
 * package's src/core, unchanged, and a figure should not need to read it.
 *
 * Every figure is drawn in a 400 × 320 viewBox. World space is x/y on the
 * ground and z up. Plates are filled with the ground colour and painted back
 * to front, so a nearer one covers a farther one: append in that order. At
 * the default camera, Cam(45, 0.5, S), +x runs down to the right and +y down
 * to the left, so the corner with the largest x and y is nearest the viewer:
 * append by ascending x + y, from the far corner (smallest x and y) to it.
 *
 * Camera
 *   Cam(azDeg, k, S)                       a camera: azimuth in degrees, k = sin(elevation) (0.5 is the 2:1 view), S = scale
 *   fit(C, points, cx, cy)                 centres the box of [x, y, z] points on (cx, cy); call it once, before proj
 *                                          it only centres, it never scales: choose S by trying values, with the most extreme pose in points.
 *                                          The six figures use S 1.42 to 2.12; the boxes they fit come out 230 to 310 wide and 180 to 245 tall
 *   proj(C)                                returns P(x, y, z), which gives [sx, sy]
 *   unproj(C, sx, sy, z)                   the world [x, y] under a screen point, on the plane at height z
 *   facing(C)                              returns front(sample): whether a ring sample faces the camera
 * Rounded solids
 *   rrect(u0, v0, u1, v1, r, n)            a rounded rectangle, as a ring of samples {u, v, nu, nv}
 *   circ(R, n)                             a circle, as a ring
 *   rings(x0, y0, x1, y1, r, b)            [ring, inner]: a rounded footprint and its crease ring, inset by b
 *                                          r, the corner radius, is cut to half the shorter side. b, the crease's inset in world units
 *                                          (0.6 to 2.2 in the figures), must stay under half the shorter side or the crease turns inside out
 *   prism(P, front, ring, inner, z0, z1)   {sil, crease}: a solid standing from z0 to z1, as two path strings
 *   ringAt(P, ring, z)                     the ring's points, projected at height z
 *   run(ring, keep)                        the one cyclic run of samples that pass keep
 *   hull(points)                           the convex hull of screen points
 *   extremes(P, ring)                      [left, right, nearest] samples: where dashed drops fall from
 *   fillet(points, radii, n)               rounds every vertex of a closed polygon; returns the new points
 *                                          radii is an array, one radius per vertex, each cut to half its shorter edge; a single number gives NaN.
 *                                          n is the steps round each corner, default 4: each vertex becomes n + 1 points
 *   ghost(P, front, ring, z0, depth)       a reflection's path {d, y0, y1}; reflect() draws it for you
 * Paths and numbers
 *   poly(points)                           a closed path string
 *   open(points)                           an open polyline string
 *   seg(a, b)                              one segment between two screen points [sx, sy], as its own subpath; project world points with P first
 *   clamp(v, a, b)
 *   lerp(a, b, t)
 *   rad(deg)
 *   r2(n)                                  two decimals
 * The continuous clock: one spring per moving number
 *   spring(x, opts)                        at rest on x; write .t to retarget; opts {k, c, m, eps}, default k 100, c 18, m 1
 *   stepS(sp, dt)                          advances by dt seconds; returns whether it is still moving
 * The discrete clock: a 700ms tween on (.32, .72, 0, 1)
 *   tween(v, dur)                          at rest on v; dur defaults to 700 (ms)
 *   tset(tw, to, now, delay)               retargets from where it is, after delay ms: the stagger
 *                                          the same target again does nothing, so calling it on every pointer move is safe
 *   tval(tw, now)                          its value at now
 *   tdone(tw, now)                         whether it has landed
 *   bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2)                 a CSS cubic-bezier, as a function of progress
 *   EASE_LIFT                              the lift curve itself
 *   reducedMotion()                        true when the reader asked for less motion; springs and tweens already land at once
 *   setReducedMotion(on)                   the loop's business, not a figure's
 * Drawing
 *   mk(tag, attrs, parent)                 one svg element: the only way a figure makes a node
 *   solid(parent)                          {g, sil, cr}: a group holding a silhouette path and a crease path
 *   put(solid, paths)                      writes prism()'s {sil, crease} into solid()'s {sil, cr}: sil into sil, crease into cr
 *   flatDot(parent, C, r, cls)             a dot lying on the ground plane; cls is "dot", "dot m" or "dot off"
 *   place(el, point)                       moves a dot or a circle to [sx, sy]
 *   reflect(svg, parent, P, front, ring, z0, depth)   a fading mirror under a solid
 *   fade(svg, y0, y1, a0)                  a vertical fade, as a mask; returns the value for a mask attribute
 * Life
 *   register(stage, tick)                  joins the one frame loop; tick(dt in seconds, now in ms) returns true to ask for another frame; gives {wake, unregister}
 *   pointer(stage, handlers)               {move(point), down(point), leave()}, points in viewBox units; returns its disposer
 *   disposer()                             {add, on, dispose}: collects tear-down, so destroy is bag.dispose
 * The bench's business, not a figure's
 *   css(lightDark)
 *   inject(root)
 *   tour(stage, stops, onStop)             an unseen pointer that walks the stops, [x, y] in viewBox units or null to leave, and gives way to a real one; onStop(i) on each arrival; returns {stop}
 *   LAP                                    the default stops: a diamond around the centre, then a leave
 *
 * Classes, on path, polygon, ellipse and line. They are the whole palette; a
 * figure sets no colour, width or fill of its own.
 *     (none)   filled with the ground colour, medium stroke
 *     sil      the silhouette's stroke        hi    the bright stroke: the only highlight
 *     lo       the dim stroke                 nf    no fill        fo   fill only, no stroke
 *     dash     a dashed guide
 *     dot      a bright dot                   dot m   a medium dot     dot off   a dim dot
